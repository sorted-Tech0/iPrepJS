(1) VAR: var are functionally scoped, if the var is declared then it will be same for every variable which is cionsuming it and it won't get affacted if it is redeclare again and if it is reassigned then from that point that reassigned value will be used for whole function scope.

(2) HOISTING: 
Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution.
Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
This allows variables to appear in code before they are defined.
