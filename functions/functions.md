note:
(1.) functions return undefined by default
(2) You can pass anything in the function parameter you want.
(3) functions are first class citizen cuz they can refer to the another reference too and this is called functions expression
(4) ANNONYOUS FUNCTION: when the functions are declared via reference without the function name.

(5) IIFIs: IImediately Invoked functio expression, they run on their own.

(6) ARROW FUNCTION: short in syntax, and it bind this for us automatically
(7)  passing function as an argument in the function and returning function from another function, that's why they are called as first class citizens.
(8) while returning an inner function from an outer function, so inner function could be an annonymous function.
