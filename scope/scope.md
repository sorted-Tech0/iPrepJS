(1) Scope: The area where the varibale and funtions are grt find
(2) In JS functions are lexically scoped, i.e. the varible value will be taken that one which lies before the function definition not before function calling
(3) SCOPE-CHAINING: The variable seek for the value locally first and then outside of the function executuion stack if it didn't get it, so this process is called scope chaining.
Without scope chaining JS Engine won't be able to resolve the conflict what value shout it pick for the varible, scope chaining help that to pick that value.
